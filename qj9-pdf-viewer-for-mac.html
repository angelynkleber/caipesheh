E.g Skim works very well with LaTeX, but is difficult to get to work properly in dark mode. Similarly, Acrobat Reader has a decent dark mode, but not even a reload pdf option it seems. I tried Zathura, but the window didn't respond to my window movement hotkeys. Firefox: Includes a PDF viewer; Google Chrome: Includes a PDF viewer; Preview: macOS's default PDF viewer (in Mac OS X v10.5 and later, it also can rotate, reorder, annotate, insert, and delete pages.

I do CAD work and the typical mouse wheel-centric navigation, where scrolling the wheel zooms in and out, and holding down the scroll wheel grabs the screen and lets you pan around. This would be great when it comes to navigating around PDFs of large drawing sheets, it works great in CAD applications and it seems like there would be some PDF viewer out there that would support it. Anyone have any suggestions. I had tried other renowned brand of PDF Readers for Mac OS but was very disappointed by the bloated and extremely slow performance due to the number of add-ins it consisted of. However, I am very happy with the way SysTools PDF Reader for Mac functions.  Hey guys, I recently switched from a Windows PC to a macbook pro, and I was wondering what good pdf readers are there. On my old pc I had pdfs of a few textbooks with bookmarks that would link me to specific chapters, but on preview when I open these same files, I don't see the bookmarks, and I cannot see them on the Adobe Reader for Mac either. As such I'm looking for pdf readers that would show these bookmarks.
