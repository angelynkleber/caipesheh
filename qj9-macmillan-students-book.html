Don't mention the title of the book in comments. by Zelma Gray IN order to appreciate fully the merits of an author, it is necessary to throw a search-light upon the period in which he wrote. His writings should not be studied alone, isolated from their companions, but should be viewed in relation to their social, political, and his- torical conditions. This is particularly advisable in criticizing the literature of a previous century whose. by Zelma Gray The Spectator, which first appeared before the public March 9. 1711, was a folio sheet 12 1/4 inches high and 8 inches wide. If we may judge by the letters which Addison——who was joint contributor with Steele—— received, the paper then as now conceded to be the best of the numerous papers published, and pos- sessed a great number of delighted readers. George Trusty writes:——.

Summary: After a restless night, Harry awakens to chaos: everyone is racing around, trying to pack as quickly as possible. The Advance Guard is accompanying Harry and the others to King’s Cross Station, and Sirius insists upon coming along in his dog form, much to Mrs. Weasley's dismay. They wait for Sturgis Podmore, who is late, but eventually move on without him. Sirius, who has been confined until now, scampers around and snaps at pigeons.

Today was an interview with the author, Nishta Mehra, where she talked about the intriguing situation of an interracial lesbian couple adopting a child of a different race (from both of them). She has authored a book (https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250133557) about this and gave a different type of Valentine’s Day story that I would expect from The Takeaway. Whether you think this is a unheralded story deserved of a bigger spotlight or The Takeaway’s holy trinity in finding a couple. Summary: It is a fortnight after Harry's detention with Umbridge has ended before Hermione dares to ask if Harry has considered teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry quietly admits he has, to Ron's relief: he had been afraid that Harry would start shouting again. Hermione recommends teaching anyone wanting to learn, though Harry believes only a few will attend. He is, after all, "a nutter." The first meeting is set to take place during the next Hogsmeade weekend to avoid Umbridge. 
Note: This is a repost to change the title as the original post's title made it clear that McGonagall appeared in FB:CoG. At the time of posting I didn't think this was a spoiler because her (minor) role was revealed before the release of the movie and I thought this was fairly well known, but I realize that not everyone would have followed these things, so I apologize if it may have spoiled for anyone. Below is what I think is a reasonable explanation of how Minerva McGonagall’s appearance. Kindly note that the price range mentioned above is only for the books in the megathread list.

Below is what I think is a reasonable explanation of how Minerva McGonagall’s appearance in FB:CoG can fit in with the already existing canon, and why the previous fan-estimates of her birth year (and therefore age) are likely to be wrong. Please feel free to offer corrections/addendums to anything I’ve gotten wrong or may have overlooked, especially because I’m not great with inclusive/exclusive date counting.

Summary: Early in the morning, Harry writes to Sirius saying that he is perfectly alright and not to worry about him. He goes to the Owlery and persuades a still-aloof Hedwig to carry the message to Sirius. Harry is certain Sirius' reply will make things better. Hermione remonstrates with him later, claiming that what he wrote to Sirius is a lie. Harry says he does not care; he will not do anything to increase the risk of Sirius going to Azkaban again.
