I'm working on a possible new openSUSE Download Page The prototype is at It's far from complete, I know not all pages are present yet, and I have plenty of placeholder text where there will be links in the future, but I think it's ready to start gathering feedback on it.

For downloading CD or DVD images, there is software.opensuse.org to help with choosing the correct download. It also uses the below mirrors. Additional information about downloading openSUSE can be found in the openSUSE wiki. The best (and fastest!) way to download CD or DVD images is with a Metalink client.  All i want is a good package management, bleeding edge, stability and compatibility with the "internet packages" (deb/rpm) for installation. I find manjaro is pretty good since it has packman and for negative part, no actual support for deb/rpm. I know they are exclusive to ubuntu and fedora but still if i wanted an application which is not popular enough and its NOT in the AUR but has deb/rpm files on its website to download, i wont have the tools to run it. So please help me pick out a distrib. On the dedicated download section you will also find minimalistic CDs that can be used to install openSUSE over the network, as well as optional Add-On CDs with support for extra languages. The DVD installation medium is the best choice for those who want to deploy openSUSE on desktop or server computers. I've set the threshold to start charging at 40% and stop at 80%.

Running desktop.sh generates a Deltarune.desktop file for you and copies it onto your desktop and menu. If later I have problems with using download.opensuse.org (https://download.opensuse.org), it tries to redirect to provo-mirror.opensuse.org (https://provo-mirror.opensuse.org) but it does not contain all files from original. I am attempting to download Linux distributions and it seems like maybe my network is having issues downloading any large (1GB+) file regardless of mirror from any major distro site (Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Mint, OpenSUSE). The download gets to about 99% complete and then fails. There are partial completed download files in my downloads folders to prove something is downloading) but doesn't complete. Failures occur across all three major browsers (Chrome, FF, IE) and I have tried clearing browser. I just got a new laptop, installed fedora, installed a lot of apps, and went on youtube. And a lot of the newer videos won't play. I searched for hours, and finally found the solution, so I thought I'd share them with you, in case someone has similar problems. 1. enable rpmfusion repos (I already had) 2. install open h264 codec (I already had) 3. install ffmpeg (this was my solution, but you will need the other 2 steps first). Hi everyone. I've been on ubuntu based distros for quite some time. I love the stable core of ubuntu but i don't like the mess that is PPAs. A lot of the packages i use in ubuntu are quite old so it forces me to use PPAs which i don't like. With the development programs i use i want to always be using the latest stable version of like git, nodejs, python, golang, ect. Awhile back someone recommended opensuse leap. They said it release cycle was kind of like ubuntu and was very stable 
I have some questions and confusions. What is considered a distribution upgrade in Tumbleweed? Is it based around the Tumbleweed snapshots? Am I supposed to have enabled or disabled the "openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Update" repo when I'm using the boombatower `tumbleweed-cli`? The tumbleweed program describes `migrate` as "Migrate from boombatower hosting to download.opensuse.org.". Could someone explain the difference there for practical usage. Is there usually a delay in the snapshot appear. I followed the commands listed on the website but can't get lutris to install. Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?? alan@alan-HP-EliteBook-8470p:\~$ ver=$(lsb\_release -sr); if \ $ver != "18.10" -a $ver != "18.04" -a $ver != "16.04" \ ; then ver=18.04; fi alan@alan-HP-EliteBook-8470p:\~$ echo "deb ( /" sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lutris. I tried deciphering this error, but to no avail. I feel like I've asked this sort of thing before, but hey, no harm in asking. The error's in this paste. (https://pastebin.com/Sd6RPw9c) It seems like only the OpenSUSE debian repositories aren't downloading, and that's bad news, because I use Pale Moon, and it comes from one of those repos. I've had this issue on both my desktop and laptop. Hello. Does anyone know why my download speed on steam is so horrible? It is usually peaking at 200 KB/S compared to my Windows installation 20+ MB/S. Why do I get piss poor performance on openSUSE. Also some websites takes longer to load on openSUSE compared to windows, even though according to speedtest (https://i.imgur.com/W9fF6cv.png) I have better ping and download speed on openSUSE. Any help is appreciated. I recently downloaded ISO file and did md5sum. Kindly let me know if the file is all clear? $ md5sum openSUSE-Leap-15.0-NET-x86_64.iso f11ace0b9bff44f30dda9fb703e97d2e And since I'm new to OpenSuse I am mostly using it for programming, browsing, playing videos. I have 2GB Ram and i3 machine and I would want to chose xfce. Will it be fine to use? How much maximum download I might have to make during installation. Getting this error on update or distribution upgrade. Any suggestions on how to solve. Is anyone else having trouble getting lutris to launch in ubuntu after its latest update (earlier this week)? Attempts to launch it in the terminal give me a cryptic error (to me, very much a non developer) about a problem on line 25. A stab in the dark, but I'm thinking I either wait until someone else sees the problem and fixes it or try to find a way to install an earlier version. Any other suggestions? I don't want to have to break down and \ clutches pearles\ boot Windows 
Hello. I just installed steam on openSUSE leap 42.3 and I get horrible download speeds, peaking at 90 KB/S compared to my windows installation 19.7 MB/S. Why do I get piss poor performance on openSUSE, I have never had this issue in the past running ubuntu? Also, the download progress is reset when I exit steam or reboots the system, is also quite annoying. Any help is appreciated. Download VirtualBox (Old Builds): VirtualBox 6.0.
